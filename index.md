## ACSIA on GitHub

ACSIA uses GitHub for open source collaboration for ongoing research projects. The goal with for our GitHub page is to provide a simple, uncluttered space where we can communicate with our collaborators (co-conspirators?), provide updates current research projects, and more.

Join us to support open source projects on challenges in sub-Saharan Africa or on the nonprofits communities in NYC and Paris!
